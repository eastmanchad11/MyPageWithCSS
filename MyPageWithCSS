<h1><h1>Phillies are gonna win the Word Series</h1>
<p>This weekend the underdog Phillies knocked off the power house Braves. I believe they are going to win the world series because the team they play next is the Padres, who they got the best of them throughout the season. They are almost 100% healthy, and they are averaging over 5 runs a game during the playoffs. Take it to the bank! </p>
